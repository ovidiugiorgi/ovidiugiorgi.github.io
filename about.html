	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Ovidiu Giorgi and I am currently pursuing my BS degree in Computer Science at the University of Bucharest, Romania.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am also a junior developer at <a href="http://www.bigstep.com">Bigstep</a>, an up-and-coming big data cloud company.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the job I mostly use JavaScript, Node.js and PHP, but in my free time I also like to fiddle around with technologies such as
		Python, Java, C#, and, most often than not, C++ for game development purposes or for practicing my problem solving skills.
